# Yahoo Fantasy API Parser Update

## Summary

Created specific TypeScript interfaces to match the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API response structure and updated the parser to be type-safe and more robust.

## Changes Made

### 1. New File: `server/src/yahoo-types.ts`

Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces that match the Yahoo Fantasy API response structure:

- **`YahooFantasyResponse`** - Root response structure
- **`YahooLeagueInfo`** - League metadata (name, ID, settings, dates, etc.)
- **`YahooStandingsWrapper`** - Container for standings data
- **`YahooTeamWrapper`** - Team data structure
- **`YahooTeamInfo`** - Array of team info objects (team_id, name, managers, etc.)
- **`YahooTeamPoints`** - Season point totals
- **`YahooTeamStandings`** - Win/loss records, rank, points for/against

Also defined normalized interfaces for internal use:

- **`NormalizedLeague`** - Simplified league structure
- **`NormalizedTeam`** - Team with computed stats
- **`WeeklyTeamScore`** - Weekly scoring data

### 2. Updated: `server/src/parsers.ts`

Completely rewrote the `normalizeLeague()` function to:

1. **Type-safe parsing** - Uses specific Yahoo interfaces instead of `any`
2. **Proper structure navigation** - Correctly handles Yahoo's nested array structure where `league` is an array containing `[LeagueInfo, StandingsWrapper]`
3. **Extract all team data**:
   - Team ID and name from the info array
   - Season totals from team_points
   - Rankings, wins, losses, ties from team_standings
4. **Better error handling** - Returns fallback structure on errors
5. **Realistic synthetic data** - Generates weekly scores based on season averages with variance

## Testing

Created `test-parser.js` which successfully parses the sample league data:

```
League: What's Your Fantasy League
League ID: 329011
Total Teams: 12

Top 5 Teams:
  1. Penix Envy FFC - 6-1-0 (85.7%) - 801.56 pts
  2. Uncle Jon's two-handed touch - 5-2-0 (71.4%) - 796.14 pts
  3. Bridget's Boss Team - 5-2-0 (71.4%) - 765.6 pts
  4. BED BATH & BIJAN - 4-3-0 (57.1%) - 846.1 pts
  5. JURASSIC CHARK - 4-3-0 (57.1%) - 802.58 pts
```

## API Response Structure

Yahoo Fantasy API returns standings in this specific format:

```typescript
{
  fantasy_content: {
    league: [
      { /* league info: name, id, settings, etc. */ },
      {
        standings: [{
          teams: {
            "0": { team: [[info objects], points, standings] },
            "1": { team: [[info objects], points, standings] },
            ...
            "count": 12
          }
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The parser now correctly handles this structure instead of making assumptions about the data shape.

## Benefits

1. **Type Safety** - Catch errors at compile time
2. **Better Documentation** - Interfaces serve as API documentation
3. **Maintainability** - Clear structure makes updates easier
4. **Correctness** - Properly extracts all team data (wins, losses, rankings)
5. **Extensibility** - Easy to add more Yahoo API endpoints with proper typing
